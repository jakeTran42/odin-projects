    <!-- Your JavaScript, for the most part, is run whenever the JS file is run, 
      or when the script tag is encountered in the HTML. 
      If you are including your JavaScript at the top of your file, 
       of these DOM manipulation methods will not work because the 
       JS code is being run before the nodes are created in the DOM. 
       The simplest way to fix this is to include your JavaScript at the bottom of your HTML file 
       so that it gets run after the DOM nodes are parsed and created. -->
