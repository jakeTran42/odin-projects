    <h2>What is Karaage?</h2>
    <p>
      Pronounced as ‘ka-RA-AH-geh’, the word karaage refers to a Japanese
      cooking technique in which an ingredient is lightly coated with flour and
      deep-fried in oil. When you hear “karaage”, most of us assume it’s chicken
      karaage, but it can also be fish or vegetables. For chicken karaage, it’s
      essentially bite-size pieces of chicken thigh dusted with flour and
      deep-fried in hot oil. With tender and juicy marinated chicken coated in a
      crispy shell, karaage is a staple in Japanese home-cooked meals.

    <h2>4 Key Ingredients for Karaage</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Chicken</li>
      <p>
        In Japan, karaage is typically made with
        <strong><em>skin-on boneless chicken thighs</em></strong
        >, which has more flavor than chicken breasts. However, if you really
        want to use breasts, that’s okay. Here in the US, skin-on chicken thighs
        are always sold with bones. To save time, I usually ask my friendly
        butcher to remove the bones for me. Why do we need to use skin-on? The
        skin keeps the karaage crispy on the outside and the meat juicy inside.

      <li>Marinade/Seasonings</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Mirin</li>
        <li>Oyster Sauce</li>
        <li>Curry Powder</li>
        <li>Egg Yolk</li>
        <li>Japanese Mayo</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are so many variations of marinade/seasonings available for
        Karaage, and this is really up to you. I make mine slightly different
        all the time. However, the primary base should always include soy sauce,
        sake, and ginger. Sake helps tenderize the meat while ginger gives zing
        and removes the gamey taste. Some variations for the seasonings include:
      </p>
      <li>Coating</li>
      <p>
        This is another flexibility you can work with by testing out different
        ratios:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Potato Starch</li>
        <li>Flour + Potato Starch</li>
        <li>Rice Flour + Potato Starch</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>Deep-Frying Oil</li>
      <p>My recommendation for deep frying oil includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Canola oil (キャノーラ油)</li>
        <li>Safflower oil (べに花油)</li>
        <li>Rice bran oil (米油)</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
